Welcome to PennOS, a project designed to simulate the functionalities of a UNIX-like operating system. This project was created by Aaron Tsui, Matt Park, Joesph Cho, and Maya Huizar.

## Overview

PennOS is a UNIX-like operating system that runs as a guest OS within a single process on a host OS. It includes implementations of a basic priority scheduler, a FAT file system (PennFAT), and user shell interactions.
