The kernel side of Penn\+OS consists of three main aspects. They are described in more details on their own subpages below.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \doxysectlink{md_doc_2system}{{\bfseries{The Kernel}}}{0}\+: The kernel refers to the collection of system calls, as well as the overall datastructures and control mechanisms used by the scheduler.
\item \doxysectlink{md_doc_2scheduler}{{\bfseries{The Scheduler}}}{0}\+: The scheduler is the main function that is in charge of deciding which process to schedule/run based on priorities, blocking and unblocking processes, and idling.
\item \doxysectlink{md_doc_2shell}{{\bfseries{The Shell}}}{0}\+: The shell is simply a priority zero process that is instantiated at start, and continuously checks for user input to spawn new processes, or modify existing ones.
