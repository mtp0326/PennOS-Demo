The shell is the main process of pennos. It is declared and definen in shell. It is instatiated at tick 0, or the start of pennos, at priority 0. The shell is then scheduled by the scheduler to take in input from the user, and spawn in additional processes via s\+\_\+spawn.

The commands available to be typed in the shell can be listed by typing "{}man"{} in the shell. These are the shell level commands that are specified in the Penn\+OS assignment.
