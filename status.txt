THINGS TO DO:

everyone:
 - errno/error handling
 - run with gdb and valgrind to check for any errors/memleaks in normal operation
 - terminal control of stdin (stop processes that read from stdin if they don't have control?)
 - write README file (describe code layout, etc)

kernel only:
 - fix logging issues (if still there? was unsure but check)
 - add stress.h and stress.c (edstem #772) and test kernel
 - test orphanify + zombify
 - add signal relaying to child processes (redirect ctrl c + ctrl z)
 - have shell shutdown at EOF (kill all processes properly)
 - logout, man
 - shell scripts (3.2)
 - double check idling (htop)

fat only:
 - document all code
 - all of syscalls (idk progress on this)
 - all of shell calls (idk progress on this)
 - idk what else
 - append output redirection 


 BUGS TO REPORT:
 - bug, issue described, person/team that should fix
